Small test comparing the performance of local calls vs calls to external deps
provided by another WASM instance.

Findings:

Firefox:
 - local calls:    926M/s
 - external calls: 267M/s

Chrome:
 - local calls:    613M/s
 - external calls: 177M/s

So there's a ~3.5x penalty for external calls.

Also there doesn't appear to be additional penalities in the dependency
instance (see t2 which does all the work in the "bar" dependency and uses a
pointer provided by "foo" just to show that memory is shared)
