roundtrip latency tests against a public ip, server and client on the same
network. i found no noticeable difference between accessing a local ip and a
public ip (relates to all tests except 4G).

just http, no https/tls.

websocket latencies seem better across the board.

the "touch-action: manipulation;" CSS rule on the buttons prevents a 300ms
"touch delay" on mobile (touch delay allows double-tapping an element before
firing any event handlers).

desktop, lan:
  http: ~4ms
  ws:   ~1ms

desktop, wifi:
  http: ~6ms
  ws:   ~3ms

mobile, wifi:
  http: ~22ms
  ws:   ~15ms

mobile, 4G:
  http: ~55ms
  ws:   ~40ms
