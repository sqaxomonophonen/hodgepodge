Arduino program that reads from ADC A0 and sends the value over serial to the
read_from_tty.c program.

The Makefile is for arduino-bsd-mk, so it won't work with gmake etc.
But you can probably compile pedal.cpp using the IDE.

Oddities found using the arduino-bsd-mk pkg on FreeBSD:
 - Renaming Makefile to Makefile.bsd doesn't work
 - Having your code in main.cpp doesn't work (says "main" not found?)

I'm using it to convert an Ernie Ball volume pedal into a foot controller.
Wiring:
  Pedal in  ground  <=> Arduino gnd
  Pedal in  signal  <=> Arduino 5V
  Pedal out ground  <=> Arduino gnd
  Pedal out signal  <=> Arduino A0
It works really well: it's smooth, not noisy, and uses the entire range
[0;1023]. Also I expected some logarithmic taper but there isn't much, so it's
hardly worth considering to compensate.
