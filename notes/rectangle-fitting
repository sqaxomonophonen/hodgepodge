We have two rectangles, r0 and r1, and r0 must be fitted into r1; i.e. r0 must
be scaled and positioned so that it is both optimally centered inside r1, and
as large as possible without overflowing r1.

======== pseudo code ========

aspect0 = r0.width / r0.height
aspect1 = r1.width / r1.height

if aspect0 > aspect1 {
	/* r0's aspect ratio is wider than r1's; r0's left and right borders
	 * must touch r1's left and right borders; r0's top and bottom margin
	 * must be the same */
	x0 = 0
	x1 = r1.width
	scale = r1.width / r0.width
	margin = (r1.height - r0.height*scale) / 2
	y0 = margin
	y1 = r1.height - margin

} else {
	/* r0's aspect ratio is narrower than r1's; r0's top and bottom borders
	 * must touch r1's top and bottom borders; r0's left and right margin
	 * must be the same */
	y0 = 0
	y1 = r1.height
	scale = r1.height / r0.height
	margin = (r1.width - r0.width*scale) / 2
	x0 = margin
	x1 = r1.width - margin
}
